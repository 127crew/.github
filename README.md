# 127Crew

127Crew is a non-profit developer collective focused on advancing open-source technology.  
Founded in 2024 by a small group of university students, we have grown into a global community of developers, researchers, and creators.

The name comes from **127.0.0.1**, the loopback address for "localhost", a reminder that every journey in tech begins at home—your first line of code, your first project, your first contribution.
